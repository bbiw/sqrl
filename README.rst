SQRL is an interesting protocol. I would love to see it implemented and adopted.

Unfortunately, I can't currently afford to dedicate the time necessary to develop this code. 
I don't remember even whether this code works or not. (probably not).

Feel free to use this code however you want, but you may be better off starting from scratch.
